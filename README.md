Dependencies
-------------------------------------
Some functions require dependencies packages to be installed.
There are three dependencies and the rest are optional dependencies.
The optional dependencies are left to user discretion.
Software will check for missing dependencies and report if user 
tries to use a function which requires a missing one.
Software will display installed dependencies packages on cylon info page.
also "n/a" is usually displayed besides uninstalled options in menus.

gnu-netcat and openbsd-netcat perform same function, 
only 1 can be or needs to be installed, both included because of conflicts.
There are used to check that network is "up" at various points in program.

Auracle and trizen are both AUR helpers you can install 
one or both depending on preference. Auracle is a more minimalist helper. 
trizen is more fully featured. 
Auracle is used for -u and -n functions, plus step 24 of the package list maker
Auracle is new and still in development hence the -git extension.
libnotify should be installed on the vast majority of Arch systems already.
dialog should already be installed in an arch linux system installed by
the arch linux installation guide on wiki. If you install Arch some other way
It may not be there, so included as depends. 
expac is used a lot and will be already installed on many systems. 
pacman_contrib contains numerous tools(checkupdates pacache etc)related to pacman.

| Non-Optional Dependencies | Usage |
| ------ | ------ |
| dialog | used to make file select menus  |
| expac |  used to create package lists |
| pacman-contrib | Misc pacman related tools |

| Optional Dependencies | Usage |
| ------ | ------ |
| libnotify | used for desktop notifications | 
| bleachbit | for system clean and shredding |
| netcat | to check for internet connection (either gnu or openbsd) | 
| rmlint | to check for lint and duplicates | 
| Arch-audit | Uses data collected by the Arch CVE team |
| lostfiles | to scan for lostfiles |
| trizen(AUR)  |  AUR helper  |
