			rmlint finds space waste and other broken things on

			Despite its name, rmlint just finds suspicious files, 
			but never modifies the filesystem itself . 
			Instead it gives you detailed reports in different formats 
			to get rid of them yourself. These reports are called outputs. 
			By default a shellscript will be written to rmlint.sh that 
			contains readily prepared shell commands to remove 
			duplicates and other finds.
